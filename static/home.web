<h2>
I'm a normal dude by day and at night... I sleep. Jokes aside, I enjoy working on all things tech, from websites, platforms to games, simulations to neural networks and AI. I spend a lot of time reading and thinking about the future.
</h2>
<h2> Recently I've been working on artificial general intelligence, machine-learning powered simulations and theoretical concept spaces. Interested in the work I'm doing? Check out some of my projects.</h2>
